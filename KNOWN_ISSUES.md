## IMU Serial Port Issue

1. `IMU Error Frame` Issue:
   - When running the demo scripts, users may encounter an issue where the IMU serial port is broken or overloaded.
   When this issue occurs, the IMU sensor may not be able to communicate with the system, leading to errors in the IMU data:
   `IMU Error Frame`. 
   - This issue can be resolved by restarting the system or reconnecting the IMU sensor.
   - As the GRx robot controller is covered inside, reboot the machine may be a better solution.
